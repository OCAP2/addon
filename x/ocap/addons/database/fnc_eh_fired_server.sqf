// After a lot of determination, in the end, engine limitations in Arma 3 with clientside projectile simulation means that the best source of truth for state is the owner.

// To achieve this, we'll do a few things.
// First, we'll remoteExec two functions to all clients.
// The first,

// We'll use the Local EH to detect changes of unit locality. Add the EH for the soldier unit on the new owner, and remove it on the old. This EH only triggers on two machines so it limits the overall impact of doing so and validates duplicate records are not sent to the server.

// We need to ensure that the handleFiredMan function exists on the clients we expect to run it.
// So we'll send the function to all clients and define it.
// We need to make sure the function is available at the new name on the server, since it may be running these as well as the owner of AI.
